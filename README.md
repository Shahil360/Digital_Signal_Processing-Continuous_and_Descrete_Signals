# Digital_Signal_Processing

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for generating and plotting both continuous-time and discrete-time signals including unit impulse, unit step, unit ramp, exponential, signum, and sinc functions. The code is split into three filesâ€”continuous_signals.m (continuous), discrete_signals.m (discrete) and time_sinc_funtions.m.
